                <p>
                    Without education and instruction, democracy can quickly find itself under threat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why we created the Forum Academy, an educational resource providing key insights and training in both the blockchain-based Forum Cooperative platform as well as a host of other election- and polling-related resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Forum Cooperative is excited at the promise Forum Academy offers: A think tank where ideas can incubate, gain traction and become actionable.
                </p>
